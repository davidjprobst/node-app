What is a Node module?

> A set of functions that are written and included in your application together.

What is the main difference between `exports` and `module.exports`?

> `module.exports` gets returned outside of the module while `exports` is not available outside of the module.

Why is using `exports` recommended?

> `exports` is recommended because it not returned by `require()`. `module-exports` returns the entire object reference in `require()`
